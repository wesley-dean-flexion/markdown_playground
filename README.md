# Markdown Playground

This is examples of Markdown that we discussed during our demo session thingee.

A good reference may be [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

The current [TTS Website](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services)
uses Markdown along with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) to update the site when
files in their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/tts.gsa.gov) changes.
